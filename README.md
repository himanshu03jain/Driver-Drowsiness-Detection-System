# Driver Drowsiness Detection 

It is my 2nd-year college project with 2 team members more using machine learning.

It can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving and calculate scores, if this score limit is high then the alarm will ring.
## Scope
The scope of the Drowsy Driver Detection in the modern period is to diminish the vehicle street mishap and furthermore this project is utilized for security reasons for a driver as it reduces car accidents. The fatigue detection system in this project is capable of detecting drowsiness on drivers and then based on the current situation will alert the driver using an alarm.

## Problem statement
Fatigue is a safety problem that has not yet been deeply tackled by any country in the world mainly because of its nature. Fatigue, in general, is very difficult to measure or observe unlike alcohol and drugs, which have clear key indicators and tests that are available easily. Probably, the best solutions to this problem are awareness about fatigue-related accidents and promoting drivers to admit fatigue when needed. The former is hard and much more expensive to achieve, and the latter is not possible without the former as driving for long
hours is very lucrative.
